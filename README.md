HELLO WORLD NEXT LEVEL
======================

### What is this?
The Hello, World project is universally accepted as a ritual to appease the gods of programming. It usually takes a line or two. Or three. That is not a lot. 

I decided to take a different approach and over-engineer the Hello, World script to the maximal ridiculousness level I can deliver.

### But James, why?
Exactly.

### [this] or [that] is inefficient and could be written in a better way!
Yes. Probably. What's your point?

### Do you feel this is an achievement?
That is a valid question, and I applaud you for it.

### I feel like I can complicate this project even more.
Please do and let me know.
